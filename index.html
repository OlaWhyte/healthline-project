        <p>Have you ever wished you had a sixth sense? Some say to look no farther than between your eyes.

            The chakras are believed to be wheel-like energy centers distributed throughout your body that affect well-being and perception. The third eye chakra, also known as Ajna, is considered to be the sixth chakra in the body. </p>
        <p>This chakra is said to be located in the center of your head, parallel to the middle of your eyebrows. It’s believed to be linked to perception, awareness, and spiritual communication.

            Some say that when open, the third eye chakra can provide wisdom and insight, as well as deepen your spiritual connection. </p>
        <p>While there’s no scientific evidence to support these claims, many traditions and cultures emphasize the importance of the third eye chakra.

            Let’s dive deeper into what the third eye is, what it can do, and how to open it.</p>
        <h1>What is the third eye chakra?</h1>
        <p>The third eye chakra is believed to be related to:</p>
        <ul class="section-oneul">
            <li>clarity</li>
            <li>concentration</li>
            <li>imagination</li>
            <li>intution</li>
            <li>spiritual perception</li>
            <li>universal connection</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This chakra is believed to be linked to the pineal gland, according to Candice Covington, author of “Essential Oils in Spiritual Practice: Working with the Chakras, Divine Archetypes, and the Five Great Elements.”

            “The pineal gland is a pea-sized gland shaped like a pine cone, located in the vertebrate brain near the hypothalamus and pituitary gland,” says Covington. “It’s a revered tool of seers and mystics and is considered to be the organ of supreme universal connection.”</p>
        <p>Covington notes that the pineal gland plays a significant role in most cultures throughout the world.

            “For example, in Ayurvedic philosophy, the third eye is represented by the Ajna chakra,” she says. “In Ancient Egypt, the symbol of the Eye of Horus mirrors the placement of the pineal gland in the profile of the human head.” </p>
        <p>According to Covington, the pineal gland is the biological relative of the energetic third eye chakra.

            This tiny gland at the base of the skull produces melatonin, which affects circadian rhythms and reproductive hormones.
            
            Studies show a link between the pineal gland and N, N-dimethyltriptamine, also known as DMT, according to a 2019 research reviewTrusted Source.
            
            This chemical is sometimes called “the spirit molecule” or “the seat of the soul” because of its supposed relationship to consciousness. </p>
        <p>Still, the link between the pineal gland and spiritual experience hasn’t been scientifically proven.</p>
        <h1>What can the third eye chakra do?</h1>
        <p>While there isn’t scientific evidence to prove it, Covington believes that the third eye is a window to the spiritual world.</p>
        <p>“Developing the third eye is the doorway to all things psychic,” she says. “The illusion of separation between self and spirit dissolves when the third eye connection is cultivated.”</p>
        <p>What’s more, Covington says you can run into problems if your third eye chakra is blocked. This can include:</p>
        <ul class="section-oneul">
            <li>confusion</li>
            <li>uncertainty</li>
            <li>cynicism</li>
            <li>lack of purpose</li>
            <li>pessimism</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“While the physical eyes perceive the physical world, the third eye sees the true world — a unified whole with an unyielding connection to spirit,” says Covington.</p>
        <p>She says the benefits of opening your third eye can include:</p>
        <ul class="section-oneul">
            <li>mental clarity</li>
            <li>improved concentration</li>
            <li>clear self-expression</li>
            <li>strengthened intuition</li>
            <li>a sense of bliss</li>
            <li>decisiveness</li>
            <li>insight</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>The third eye and mental health</h1>
        <p>While more research is needed about how the third eye can affect us spiritually and emotionally, a 2016 study suggests that smaller pineal gland volume may be linked to mood disorders like schizophrenia.</p>
        <p>Some people have hypothesized a link between the chakras and mental health, but this isn’t accepted by mainstream science.</p>
        <p>The role of the third eye has also been discussed in parapsychology, or the study of unexplainable mental phenomena. Some believe that, when open, the third eye acts as a doorway for spiritual communication. </p>
        <p>This is said to include:</p>
        <ul class="section-oneul">
            <li>telepathy</li>
            <li>clairvoyance</li>
            <li>lucid dreaming</li>
            <li>astral projection</li>
            <li>aura perception</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>How to open your third eye</h1>
        <p>Some traditions emphasize the need to open and harmonize all your other chakras prior to opening the third eye.</p>
        <p>This is said to establish the grounding and capacity necessary to handle the insights of higher consciousness. Otherwise, some believe that opening the third eye could be destabilizing.</p>
        <p>If you feel ready to open your third eye chakra, Covington suggests the following methods:</p>
        <ul class="section-oneul">
            <li>Activate your third eye.</li>
            <li>Supplement your diet.</li>
            <li>Apply essential oils.</li>
            <li>Try sun gazing.</li>
            <li>Practice meditation and chanting.</li>
            <li>Use crystals.</li>
        </ul>
